# The Tenebrio Genome project
The yellow mealworm beetle, \textit{Tenebrio molitor}, is a promising alternative protein source for animal and human nutrition. Here we provide the methods and data to construct in 280Mb Genome

## Underlying and extended data
In this git rep, you will find all the detailed wolkflow and methods used for the mealworm genome assembly and genome annotation.

## Tenebrio genome assembly
For more details on the genome assembly method, you can read the notebook assembly_workflow.pdf. Some of th scripts available from the Genoscope github https://github.com/institut-de-genomique, especially the genome polisher Hapo-G (https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/HAPO-G) 
## Tenebrio genome annotation
For more details on the genome annotation, you can read the notebook annotation_workflow.html. The genome annotation is based on the GMOVE annotater available at https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/Gmove
## This work is part of the Tenebrio genomic project H2020 FARMYNG
