# The Tenebrio Genome project
The yellow mealworm beetle, <i>Tenebrio molitor</i>, is a promising alternative protein source for animal and human nutrition. Here, we provide the methods and data to construct a 280Mb mealworm genome to a chromosome-scale assembly now available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/CAJRHG010000000

## Underlying and extended data
In this repository, you will find all the detailed bioinformatic workflows and the methods versions used for the mealworm genome assembly and genome annotation.

## Tenebrio genome assembly
For more details on the genome assembly method, you can read the notebook assembly_workflow.pdf. Part of the scripts available from the Genoscope github https://github.com/institut-de-genomique, especially the genome polisher Hapo-G (https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/HAPO-G) from JM Aury et <i>al</i>. Hapo-G, haplotype-aware polishing of genome assemblies with accurate reads, NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics, Volume 3, Issue 2, June 2021, lqab034, https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqab034

## Tenebrio genome annotation
For more details on the genome annotation, you can read the notebook annotation_workflow.html. The genome annotation is based on the GMOVE annotator available at https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/Gmove from Dubarry et <i>al</i>., Gmove a tool for eukaryotic gene predictions using various evidence [version 1; not peer reviewed]. F1000Research 2016, 5(ISCB Comm J):681 (poster) (https://doi.org/10.7490/f1000research.1111735.1) 

## This work is part of the Tenebrio genomic project H2020 FARMYNG
