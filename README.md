# Tenebrio_Genome
Underlying and extended data for the Tenebrio genome project. Here You will find all the detailed wolkflow and methods used for the mealworm genome assembly and genome annotation.
## Tenebrio genome assembly
For more details on the genome assembly method, you can read the notebook assembly_workflow.pdf. Some of th scripts available from the Genoscope github https://github.com/institut-de-genomique, especially the genome polisher Hapo-G (https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/HAPO-G) 
## Tenebrio genome annotation
For more details on the genome annotation, you can read the notebook annotation_workflow.html. The genome annotation is based on the GMOVE annotater available at https://github.com/institut-de-genomique/Gmove
## This work is part of the Te nebrio genomic project H2020 FARMYNG
